# EDA-Customer-Shopping-Data

Overview: This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of customer shopping data collected from malls. The purpose of this project is to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences based on their shopping patterns. The data includes information such as invoice number, customer id, gender, age, category of product, quantity,  payment method, invoice date and name of shopping mall. The main objective is to identify trends and patterns in the data that can inform business decisions.

Data: The data used in this project is a sample of customer shopping data. The data consists of a single CSV file with over 99457 rows and 8 columns. The columns include information such as invoice number, customer id, gender, age, category of product, quantity,  payment method, invoice date and name of shopping mall.

Methodology: The project involves various EDA techniques, including data cleaning, data visualization, and statistical analysis. The first step is to clean and preprocess the data to ensure that it is ready for analysis. This includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data types where necessary.

Next, exploratory data analysis techniques are used to identify patterns and trends in the data. This includes creating visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and heat maps to understand the distribution of the data and correlations between variables. Statistical analysis techniques such analysis outliers, skewness, Tukey-5 number summary, and, hypothesis testing may also be used to test for significant relationships between variables.

Results: The results of the analysis are presented in a report that summarizes the insights gained from the EDA. The report includes visualizations and statistical analysis results that highlight trends and patterns in the data. The insights gained from the analysis can be used to inform business decisions, such as product selection and marketing strategies.

Conclusion: This project demonstrates the power of EDA in gaining insights into customer behavior and preferences based on shopping data. The insights gained from the analysis can be used to inform business decisions that can improve customer satisfaction and drive sales.
